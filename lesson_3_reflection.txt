When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You woud want to use the remote repository when you want to push files directly to github. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be a reason why you always pull changes manually, especially if you wanted to pull origin that has branches that you don't need.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	I would use forks when I wanted to clone another  GitHub repositories, thus making reference to the original repository.

	I would clones when I wanted to fetch from Github repositories to my local repository.

	I would create branches away from a master if I happened to work on adding new features or projects.
